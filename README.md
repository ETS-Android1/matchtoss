# Cricket coin toss 
This is an app that let's player perfrom the toss without needing the coin. 
Since we longer carry the coin. Nowdays often time we feel very cumbersome. 
However, while playing we often feel the vibe the tossing a real coin. In order to 
overcome the problem I have created an app that I would personally use for myself. 
Hope you find it useful too.
